*. Wine is a program which allows running all Microsoft Windows programs (.exe files)
   on linux based or like systems (unix). It consists of a program loader which 
   loads and executes a Microsoft Windows binary and a library (called Winelib) that 
   implements Windows API calls using their Unix, X11 or Mac equivalents. The library 
   may also be used for porting Windows code into native Unix executables.

*. With the help of this tool or repo you can able to run all Microsoft
   Windows programs which is (.exe files) easily with just a single click.
   My main motive to program this code was that anyone can use it easily.
